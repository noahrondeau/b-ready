# b-ready
A DIY proofing box for keeping levain, bread dough, and other ferments at stable target temperatures.
It will let me be ready to make yummy, bready treats.

## What is a proofing box?
Simply put, a proofing box is just a temperature-controlled container that maintains a stable temperature.

B-Ready is particularly tageted at levain for sourdough, since winter temperatures in my part of the world are not super conducive to keeping a culture strong and healthy.

This project is in the very beginning stages, and is still in the exploratory phase.

This repository will contain everything related to the project. The following folders exist for now:

mech/
  Physical, mechanical construction for project
  
hw/
  Electrical hardware for project
  
fw/
  Firmware for project
  
## Tertiary goals
Beyond just keeping my flour yeasty, I always want to use this project to teach myself a few skills:
* Embedded Rust: I've been wanting to learn Rust for awhile, but I'm an embedded systems engineer so application software doesn't keep me motivated to learn
* Work on some hardware: my current job is very FW-centric, it will be nice to do some hardware stuff, and improve my PCB design skills
* Have fun healthy pandemic fun
